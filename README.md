# XIM - X's Immersive Music
[Github](https://github.com/elimin-8/XsImmersiveMusic)

This mod is tested to work on Vindicta and Antistasi.
The now playing UI is quite performance heavy, with a reduction of up to 10% of the overall framerate when it's in use. Therefore, if you wish to save performance, turn this option off in the CBA settings for this mod.

## Features
* Uses almost every single track in Arma 3
* Plays calm music when daytime, and all is quiet
* Plays stealthy music at night time, when raining or foggy
* Plays combat music when the AI is shooting
* Syncs the currently playing track with your squad
* Allows you to skip the current song via the ACE self interaction menu (must be squad lead)
* Allows you to stop and start music via the ACE self interaction menu (must be squad lead)
* Categories of music can be enabled or disabled in the CBA addon options
* Combat variables can be customised in the CBA addon options
* Clients can disable or enable the now playing message in the CBA addon options
* Displays the currently playing song with a nice looking message
* Works in singleplayer, non-dedicated and dedicated
* Allows you to define a custom delay between each song (NEW!)


## Examples
You're in a nighttime OP with your team, making your way to assault a major enemy stronghold? How about some [Canton Protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQMG8FGYRso)?
You're in the middle of an intense firefight, with a friendly IFV wreaking havoc in Zaros? How about the [This is War Marksmen DLC remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl7nTK6qeSM)?
You're just chilling at base with the lads, without much going on? Try [Fighter Jets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Hr-aqCT8s).

## Note
This mod simply runs whenever you connect to a server, no setup or anything needed. However, all the clients and the server need to be running the mod.
Keys are included.

## Thanks!
Thank you to everyone in the Arma 3 discord, namely Lou and Dedmen, you guys were a huge help!
Thanks to Wietse as well, we actually have the server side code :)
And finally, thanks to chief22, who allowed me to look through his addon mood jukebox to help me create the foundation for this mod.
